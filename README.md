QUIQQER Cron (Recurring tasks)
==============================

The Cron-module extends QUIQQER by a cron manager.
The manager can schedule, manage and run recurring tasks.

Other plugins can use the cron modules API to provide their own recurring tasks.

Packagename:

    quiqqer/cron


Features
--------

- Cron-management
- Cron API


Installation
------------

```
composer require "quiqqer/cron" "dev-master"
```


CLI-only crons
--------------

Long-running crons can be restricted to command-line execution in `cron.xml`:

```xml
<cron exec="\Vendor\Package\Cron::execute" cliOnly="true">
    <!-- title and description -->
</cron>
```

If `cliOnly` is omitted or set to `false`, the cron remains available through
both CLI and web execution.
